However, manual labeling is <strong>time-consuming and costly</strong>. This project develops an intelligent Reinforcement Learning framework to address the critical problem of error propagation in semi-supervised learning.</p> <p><em>Developed as part of the Fall 2025 Capstone for the George Washington University Data Science Program.</em></p> <h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2> <p><strong>Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL)</strong> aims to leverage small amounts of labeled data alongside large amounts of unlabeled data. A common SSL technique is <strong>pseudo-labeling</strong>, where a model predicts labels for unlabeled data and trains on its own predictions.</p> <p>The core challenge: <strong>Error Propagation</strong>. When models generate incorrect pseudo-labels, they train on these errors, reinforcing mistakes and causing performance degradation.</p> <h2 id="our-approach">Our Approach</h2> <p>We implemented and enhanced the novel framework from <strong>“Reinforcement Learning-Guided Semi-Supervised Learning”</strong> (Heidari et al., 2024), which cleverly reframes pseudo-labeling as a Reinforcement Learning

more stable training:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Curriculum Learning</strong>: Gradually increasing weight over epochs allows model to learn from “easy” high-confidence samples first</li> <li>
