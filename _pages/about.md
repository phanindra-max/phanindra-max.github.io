Data scientist with 4+ years taking problems from framing to production. I build Python/SQL data pipelines, train and evaluate NLP/ML models (LLMs with vLLM), and serve models through APIs and decision-ready dashboards. I ship open-source packages with GitHub Actions CI and optimize inference on HPC/GPU with dynamic batching. Comfortable across the stack from Flask/Next.js services to analytics interfaces.

Currently serving as Lead Graduate Research Specialist at [LAiSER Lab](https://laiser.gwu.edu/) at George Washington University, where I'm spearheading the development of an open-source NLP Python package for skill gap analysis and workforce analytics. I also work as a Graduate Assistant for the Natural Language Processing course and recently completed an internship with Data Science for Sustainable Development.

I'm passionate about open-source software and developer relations. I serve as President of Google Developer Groups On-Campus at GWU and Chairperson of Relations for the Data Science Association.
